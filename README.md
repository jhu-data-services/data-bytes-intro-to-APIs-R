# Introduction to APIs in R
This repository contains workshop materials used in [JHU Data Services'](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/) workshop, Introduction to APIs in R.

Heard about Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but don't know exactly what they are or how to use them? Join Johns Hopkins Data Services in this Data Bytes session as we cover a powerful tool for researchers to access and acquire data. This presentation will introduce APIs and cover how to make API requests in R.
